## What is Phoenix BitDevs?

The Phoenix BitDevs is a place for free and open Bitcoin education in Phoenix. Discussions will be technical but are open to people of all skill levels. Join the community and #LearnBitcoinTogether!

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket, Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs, network monitors and more. After a period of discussion, some events will have presentations of open source projects, companies, research and other relevant content. A feedback and Q&A section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to socialize.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups.

Please contact the organizers if youâ€™d like to present at a future Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion.

### Legacy Website

Currently, there are 2 websites running for this meetup. This website uses an [experimental new template with AI summaries](https://github.com/Phoenixbitdevs/bitdevs-upgrade) of content. The [old website can be found here](https://Phoenixbitdevs.org/) while the organizers are still in the process of migrating content to this one.
